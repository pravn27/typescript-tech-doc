## Course overview

## Join the Community

> The course videos and exercises are only a part of the experience. In-person bootcamps foster a strong sense of community, and we've tried to replicate that here. To get the most out of the course, we highly recommend you participate in at least some of the following places:

- Use the course Q&A discussion boards here on Udemy. Zarko (our TA) and I frequently check for new questions. Participate both as an "asker" and "answerer".

- Join the Discord chat - it's a very active community with thousands of students.

- Subscribe to the YouTube channel for additional content, live streams, AMAs with me, and more!
