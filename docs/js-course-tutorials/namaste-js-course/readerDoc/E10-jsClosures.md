- What is **<mark>Block in Javascript</mark>** ?

  - Block and Scope are different things
  - **<mark>Block is defined by curly braces { }</mark>**, why & where do we use it ?
  - Block is also known as Compound Statement
    - **<mark>Block is used to combine multiple JS statements into one group</mark>**
    - why do we make group ?

    - We can use group of statement where JS expects single statement
  - **<mark>What is Block Scope</mark>** ?

    - What are variables, functions access inside the block { }
    - Check in below code

      - ```javascript
        {
          var a = 1;
          let b = 2;
          const c = 3;
        }
        ```
      - variable let & const b, c are in blocked scope
      - variable a in global scope

    - let & const can not be access outside of block scope, where as var can access the outside of block scope

      - Separate memory space for block scope variables

  - Block scope follows the lexical scope, which is lexically present, and follow the lexical scope chain pattern
