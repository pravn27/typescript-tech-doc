# E3 - Hoisting in JavaScript ðŸ”¥(variables & functions)

> Hoisting as a core concept relies on the way how Execution Context is created. In the first phase i.e. the Memory Allocation Phase all the variables and functions are allocated memory, even before any code is executed. All the variables are assigned undefined at this point in time in the local memory.

- Answer in Memory creation phase & Code execution phase

  ```javascript
  getName();
  console.log(x);

  var x = 7;

  function getName() {
    console.log("Welcome to JS");
  }
  ```

  - Ans: NO, Both are different

- **<mark>JS Hoisting is behavior where accessing all JS variables & function even before initialized it, without any error</mark>**
- Even before code starts executing, memory is allocating to all JS variables & functions during memory creation phase
